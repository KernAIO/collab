# CLAUDE.md — Kern project rules

Rules for anyone (human or AI agent) working on Kern repositories. These apply to every repo in the KernAIO org.

## We build in the open
The repositories are **public**, so every commit is visible the moment it is pushed:
- Never commit secrets, tokens, personal data, or machine-specific paths. Use `.env` (gitignored) + `.env.example`.
- Write READMEs, docs, and issue/PR text for external contributors, not for ourselves.
- Keep commit history clean and meaningful — it is part of what people judge the project by.
- Every repo carries LICENSE, CLA.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **Two licences, split at the framework boundary.** The `kernel` repo and `modules`'
  `_template` + `workflow` are **Apache-2.0** so anyone can write a closed module; the product —
  `app`, `core`, `chat`, `mail`, `collab`, `docs`, this umbrella, the first-party modules — is
  **AGPL-3.0-only**. A new package inherits its repo's licence unless it is something a third-party
  module must import, and then it is Apache-2.0 with its own LICENSE file. Apache-2.0 packages take
  only permissive dependencies. If a module author has to import an AGPL package to get something
  done, move the API — never the licence. See `LICENSING.md` and
  `docs/adr/0005-licensing-and-the-module-boundary.md`.

## Git
- Author identity: `Navid Mirzaaghazadeh <mirzaaghazadeh@icloud.com>` (already set in each repo's local git config — plain `git commit` is correct; do not override with `-c`).
- **Do not add `Claude-Session:`, `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, "Generated with", or any AI trailer/branding to commit messages, PRs, or code comments.**
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, with optional scope). Imperative mood, ≤ 72-char subject.
- Push to `origin main`. Never force-push. If `git pull --rebase` complains about unstaged files that aren't yours (parallel agents share worktrees), use `git -c rebase.autoStash=true pull --rebase`.

## Layout & workflow
- Umbrella dev workspace: `kern/` with sibling repos cloned under `kern/repos/<name>` (gitignored there). pnpm links all `@kernhq/*` packages via the umbrella workspace.
- Install dependencies ONLY via `kern/scripts/pnpm-install-locked.sh` (serialises pnpm at the umbrella root).
- Node 24 (`nvm use 24`), pnpm 10, TypeScript ~5.9, ESM/NodeNext, Biome for lint+format (run `pnpm exec biome check --write <paths>` before committing), Vitest.
- Contracts first: changes to `@kernhq/contracts` / module contracts land (and build) before their consumers.
- Modules own their data: Postgres schema `mod_<id>`, `workspace_id` + RLS on every tenant table, cross-module access only via `kernel.call()` and events. See `modules` repo `packages/_template`.
- Ports: app 5173 · core 4000 · chat 4100 · mail 4200 · collab 4300 · docs 4400.
- Dev DB on this machine: Homebrew Postgres 18 at `localhost:5432` (`kern`/`kern`); the compose Postgres listens on `${KERN_PG_PORT:-5432}` (5433 here).

## CI
Every service repository's CI runs the real suites, so the workflow starts the infrastructure they
need as service containers: Postgres (`pgvector/pgvector:pg18`) everywhere, Valkey for `chat`,
Mailpit for `mail`. Things learned the hard way:
- Address a service container as **127.0.0.1**, never `localhost` — a runner resolves `localhost` to
  `::1` first, where the published port is not listening, and `fetch` does not retry over IPv4.
- Do not set `registry-url` on `actions/setup-node` in an install job. It writes an `.npmrc` with a
  placeholder token, and npm answers a bad token with **404**, so public packages appear to vanish.
- A repository is built **standalone** in CI. `workspace:*` only resolves inside the umbrella
  workspace; depend on the published version instead.
- **Each repository's own `pnpm-lock.yaml` is what CI installs from, and you cannot refresh it from
  inside the umbrella.** Add a dependency to a package and the umbrella install updates the *umbrella*
  lockfile, leaving the repo's committed one stale — CI then fails every job at
  `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`, install-time, before a single test runs. Plain `pnpm install` in
  `repos/<name>` walks up and attaches to the umbrella; `--ignore-workspace` skips `packages/*` and
  cheerfully reports nothing to do. Clone the repo somewhere outside the workspace and run
  `pnpm install --lockfile-only` there, then copy the lockfile back.
- Skipping a test because its infrastructure is missing is fine on a laptop and dishonest in CI.
  Fail when `process.env.CI` is set.

## Writing
Documentation — READMEs, guides, runbooks, `docs/`, and any procedure someone follows — uses the
`adhd-friendly-ste-technical-writer` skill in `.claude/skills/`: goal first, one action per step,
short sentences, conditions before commands, an observable result after every important action.
It is a house style inspired by ASD-STE100, not certified compliance — do not claim otherwise.
It governs documents for readers. Code comments and commit messages keep the voice they have.

## Quality bar
- `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` must pass before pushing.
- UI follows `app/DESIGN.md` (Ink/paper design system) and must work in RTL (fa/ar) and dark mode.
- All user-facing strings go through i18n (Paraglide) — no hardcoded English in components.

## Keeping this file current
This file is how the next person — or the next agent — avoids repeating what we already worked out.
When you learn something durable, add it here **in the same commit as the change that taught you**:
- a trap that cost you time (a silent failure, a misleading error, a tool that lies about success)
- a convention you had to infer from reading several files
- a decision and the reason behind it, especially where the obvious choice is wrong
Keep it specific and short. Delete anything that stops being true — a stale note is worse than none.

# This repository: collab (real-time documents)

A Hocuspocus/Yjs server on **:4300**, path `/collab`. It owns no domain data: it authenticates the
editor against core, asks the module that owns the object whether they may read or write, merges the
edits and stores the result.

**Things worth knowing**
- Document names are `ws:<workspaceId>:<module>:<type>:<id>`. The name is what tells the service which
  workspace to check and which module to consult.
- A module grants access by exposing a `collab.access` procedure. A module that does not answer falls
  back to workspace membership, which keeps documents usable while that module is still being built.
- Hocuspocus 4 is `new Server(config)` — not `Server.configure()` — and it owns its own HTTP server, so
  health and metrics are served from the `onRequest` hook, where **rejecting** means "already handled".
- Merged state is written after edits settle (2s debounce, 15s ceiling). A plain-text snapshot is
  published periodically as `collab.document.updated` so modules can index prose without decoding the
  CRDT.
- `WebSocketPolyfill` belongs to `HocuspocusProviderWebsocket`, not `HocuspocusProvider`. Passing it to
  the provider is ignored (and rejected by the types); handing the provider a pre-built socket makes it
  stop managing the connection, so it never connects. Set the global `WebSocket` instead — that is what
  `src/testing/harness.ts` does.
